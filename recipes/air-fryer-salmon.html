    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Salmon fillets cook beautifully in an air fryer and make a delicious meal when coated in a herb seasoning and served with greens and grains</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
      <li>1 tsp mixed herbs</li>
      <li>1 tsp garlic granules (optional)</li>
      <li>4 salmon fillets (we used 4 x 130g fillets), skin on or removed</li>
      <li>1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine the salt, pepper, mixed herbs and garlic granules, if using, in a bowl, then scatter onto a plate. Rub each salmon fillet with a little olive oil and roll in the seasoning to coat.</li>
      <li>Put in the air fryer basket in one layer and cook at 180C for 8-10 mins, until cooked through. If you have larger salmon fillets they will need to be cooked for longer â€“ keep checking after 10 mins and cook in 1-2 min blasts, until ready. Serve with greens and quinoa or rice, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
