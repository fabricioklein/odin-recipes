    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Protein-packed eggs with antioxidant-rich broccoli make this a healthy and satisfying breakfast choice</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>100g thin-stemmed broccoli, trimmed and halved</li>
      <li>200g cherry tomatoes on the vine</li>
      <li>4 medium free-range eggs (fridge cold)</li>
      <li>2 wholemeal flatbreads (see Goes well with for recipe)</li>
      <li>2 tsp mixed seeds (such as sunflower, pumpkin, sesame and linseed)</li>
      <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil the kettle. Heat oven to 120C/100C fan/gas 1/2 and put an ovenproof plate inside to warm up. Fill a wide-based saucepan one-third full of water from the kettle and bring to the boil. Add the broccoli and cook for 2 mins. Add the tomatoes, return to the boil and cook for 30 secs. Lift out with tongs or a slotted spoon and place on the warm plate in the oven while you poach the eggs.</li>
      <li>Return the water to a gentle simmer. Break the eggs into the pan, one at a time, and cook for 2 1/2 - 3 mins or until the whites are set and the yolks are runny.</li>
      <li>Divide the flatbreads between the two plates and top with the broccoli and tomatoes. Use a slotted spoon to drain the eggs, then place on top. Sprinkle with the seeds and drizzle with the oil. Season with a little black pepper and the chilli flakes, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
