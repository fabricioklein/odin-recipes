    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Use an air fryer to create this tempting dish of tender chicken breasts coated in garlic, sweet paprika and herbs. Mix up the spices for interest or keep it plain if you prefer</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 chicken breats</li>
      <li>1/2 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp garlic granules</li>
      <li>1 tsp smoked sweet paprika</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Coat the chicken in the oil and set aside. In a bowl, combine the salt, garlic, paprika and mixed herbs with a good grinding of black pepper, then scatter onto a plate.</li>
      <li>Roll each oiled chicken breast in the seasoning and put in your air fryer basket. Cook at 180C for 18-20 mins, turning after 10 mins. To check it is cooked, pierce the chicken with a knife at the thickest part to see if the juices run clear. Or insert a temperature thermometer and it should read 70C. Serve with rice and greens or a salad.</li>
    </ol>
